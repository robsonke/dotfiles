# introduction
This is a simple and incomplete collection of shortcuts that I often forget. I did not document those that are common for me.

# vim
v = visual selection (V for selecting whole line)
y = copy that selection (yank)
p = paste
:set nopaste = disable auto indent on paste

# nerdtree
ctrl + w = navigate mode
+ w = cycle through windows
+ arrows = navigate

# tmux
tmux = start it
tmux ls = show all sessions
tmux kill-server = stop server
ctrl + b = activate tmux mode
+ v = new vertical panel
+ h = new horizontal panel
+ arrows = navigate over panels
+ z = zoom in/out current panel
